[PURPOSE]
The FastaValidatorUI is an application for scientists, who simply want to validate their FASTA files.
It does not require any programming skills.


[BUILDING REQUIREMENTS]
Java >=1.5


[BUILD]
Type "ant" to build FastaValidatorUi.

After you successfully built the software a jar-package 
FastaValidatorUi-1.0.jar (version might change) can be found in the dist directory.

Dependant libraries are located in the lib folder in the dist directory.

Please note that FastaValidatorUi uses the Apache Commons CLI library
(http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/index.html) by The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org).
Apache Commons CLI is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

[EXECUTION - GUI/INTERACTIVE MODE]
Type "java -jar dist/FastaValidatorUi-1.0.jar" to start the graphical user interface of the application. No additional options are needed.

The GUI allows you to select one of the four available sequence types to be validated: ALL SEQUENCES (=generic), DNA, RNA and PROTEIN
Here 'ALL SEQUENCES' is the union of the three other sequence letter alphabets. It is the default alphabet.

To validate a file simply drag and drop its icon on the window. If the window background turns 
green the file is in valid FASTA format; otherwise the background turns red and the detailed error 
is shown at the bottom line of the window.


[EXECUTION - COMMAND LINE/HIGH THROUGHPUT MODE]

Type "java -jar dist/FastaValidator-1.0.jar -nogui" to start the FastaValidatorUI in the command line mode, where the
additional available options are the following:

usage: FastaValidatorUi [-f <arg>] [-h] [-nogui] [-t <arg>] [-v]
 -f,--file <arg>      FASTA-formatted input file
 -h,--help            print this help message
 -nogui               start in non-interactive mode
 -t,--seqtype <arg>   sequence type (allowed values: all|dna|rna|protein)
 -v,--verbose         verbose mode


Note1: If no input file is given the application reads from STDIN.
Note2: If no sequence type was set the type "all" is selected.


FastaValidatorUi may exit with one of the follwoing return values:

 0    valid input
 1    unknown error
 2    input/output error
 3    invalid character in sequence
 4    invalid FASTA format
 5    handling error (don't use)
 6    user error (don't use)
